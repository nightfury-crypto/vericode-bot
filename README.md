### NEED ?

Manually track the event or event posts of so many participants is a time taking and is prone to error. A bot can do this thing within few seconds to a minute. This manual tracking, verification and token distribution is not an easy task for a human. That's why `VeriCode bot` is here to help you out in this process and speed up this verification and token distribution.
